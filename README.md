# A TGIK playlist in textform

Joe Beda - [@jbeda](https://twitter.com/jbeda) on Twitter - from [Heptio](https://heptio.com) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) fame records each Friday a TGIK session live on Youtube.

During the sessions he looks into interesting Kubernetes topics and covers one of these during the usually one hour long recording. They range from installing a Kubernetes cluster to using a cluster. The quality and content of the sessions is [super dope](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/801102768232480769).

There is already a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvmPtYZtoXOENHJiAQc6HmV2jmuexKfrJ) on YouTube for these recordings.

But to make it easier to read through and find content and/or show notes for the particular sessions I put the information into this repository.

Please contact me via [@recollir](https://twitter.com/recollir) if you have questions or suggestions regarding this repository. Any mix up here is entirely by me and not by Heptio nor Joe.
