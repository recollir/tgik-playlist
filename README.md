# A TGIK playlist in text form

Joe Beda - [@jbeda](https://twitter.com/jbeda) on Twitter - from [Heptio](https://heptio.com) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) fame records each Friday a TGIK episode live on Youtube.

During the live stream he looks into interesting Kubernetes topics and covers one of these during the usually one hour long recording. They topics range from installing a Kubernetes cluster to using a cluster or add-ons running on Kubernetes.

## Official Heptio playlist repo (as of 2018-05-18)

There is now an _official_ playlist repository under the Heptio's GitHub user. Please go and take a look at [https://github.com/heptio/tgik](https://github.com/heptio/tgik).

## This repo here

The quality and content of the episodes is [super dope](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/801102768232480769).

There is already a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvmPtYZtoXOENHJiAQc6HmV2jmuexKfrJ) on YouTube for these recordings.

But to make it easier to read through the show notes and find content for the particular episodes I put the information from YouTube into this repository.

Please contact me via [@recollir](https://twitter.com/recollir) if you have questions or suggestions regarding this repository. Any mix up here is entirely by me (and not by Heptio nor Joe).

Reach out to Heptio via [@heptio](https://twitter.com/heptio) or directly to Joe via [@jbeda](https://twitter.com/jbeda) if you have questions regarding TGIK.
